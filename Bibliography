		Hailing from the surf town of Byron Bay, Australia, The Babe Rainbow emerged in the mid-2010s, offering a lighter, flower-powered take on neo-psychedelia than some of their similarly influenced countrymen like King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard or Psychedelic Port Crumpets.  <br><br>
After gaining international exposure via 30th Century Records, they got to work delivering a trio of full-length records between 2017 and 2019. <br><br>

The Babe Rainbow (not to be confused with Canadian electronic producer Babe Rainbow) first appeared in 2015 with a self-titled EP bearing cosmic, '60s-indebted nuggets like "Ash May & Dr. Love Wisdom" and the affable "Secret Enchanted Broccoli Forest." <br><br>
After signing with Danger Mouse’s 30th Century Records, co-founders Angus Dowling (vocals, drums) and Jack "Cool-Breeze" Crowther (guitar), along with Venezuelan newcomer Lu-Lu-Felix Domingo (bass), embarked on an American tour with West Coast psych outfit the Allah-Las.<br><br>
Returning home to Byron Bay, they worked with Stu Mackenzie (King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard) to record their eponymous full-length debut, which arrived in the summer of 2017.. 
A second helping, Double Rainbow, arrived a year later following in the same sonic footsteps. The Babes kept up their schedule in 2019 with Today, their third full-length in as many years."
