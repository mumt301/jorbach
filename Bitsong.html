    <h1>Bitsong</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Based out of Malta, Bitsong is a new streaming service and music platform, offering a unique approach to music distribution on the internet. As apposed to Soundcloud, Bitsong brands their model as “the first decentralised music streaming platform”. The service aims to provide profit for the artist, and the user who listen to their music, whilst also benefiting advertisers. In the ever-evolving music industry, where artists are struggling more and more to make a living off their art, Bitsong allows advertisers to invest in songs, where the money per stream is split in favour of the artist. The blockchain-based system lets artists upload songs and attach advertisements to them. For each advertisement listened, the artist and the listener will get up to 90% of the profits that were invested by the advertiser.  </li>

        <li>Singles/Albums/Projects are released independently, bypassing any revenue being received by record labels or third party distribution groups. With it’s own currency using the Bitsong token “$BTSG”, artists can withdraw money in real-time, avoiding 3-month waits for income, common to services such as Spotify. With a growing team or directors and musicians, Bitsong appeals to the next generation of musicians, offering similar explore and search features, key to the success of services such as Spotify. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Having been only in trial since this year, a lot of information is still yet to be widely available to the public, however Bitsong has established its goals for the coming years. These include providing the user with a platform to stream, request donations, payments and insertion of advertising sponsors, as well as presenting on any Smart TV equipped with Chromecast, Smartphone app stores, or a computer through the internet. </li>
        <br> 
        <li>Since it’s beta launch early this year, Bitsong has established a fast growing audience of 177,000 listeners, multiple investors and advertising clients, as well as a growing list of supporting musicians.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The most unique factor of this streaming service is its decentralised approach. Without corporate funding, this leaves the future of music funding to those who hold an interest in it. Advertisers can choose who’s music they want to invest in, and musicians can donate money to those who they see fit. Listeners also understand that they play a part too, supporting the future of upcoming artists, instead of paying larger corporations to run them.</li>
